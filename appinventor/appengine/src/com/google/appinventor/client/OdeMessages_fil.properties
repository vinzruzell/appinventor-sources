FusionTablesStandardErrorMessage=Error on Fusion Tables query

# Description: 
FusiontablesControlHelpStringComponentPallette=<p>A non-visible component that communicates with Google Fusion Tables.  Fusion Tables let you store, share, query and visualize data tables; this component lets you query, create, and modify these tables.</p> <p>This component uses the <a href\="https\://developers.google.com/fusiontables/docs/v2/getting_started" target\="_blank">Fusion Tables API V2.0</a>.  <p>Applications using Fusion Tables must authentication to Google"s servers. There are two ways this can be done. The first way uses an API Key which you the developer obtain (see below). With this approach end-users must also login to access a Fusion Table.  The second approach is to use a Service Account. With this approach you create credentials and a special "Service Account Email Address" which you obtain from the <a href\="https\://code.google.com/apis/console/" target\="_blank">Google APIs Console</a>.  You then tell the Fusion Table Control the name of the Service Account Email address and upload the secret key as an asset to your application and set the KeyFile property to point at this file. Finally you check the "UseServiceAuthentication" checkbox in the designer.  When using a Service Account, end-users do not need to login to use Fusion Tables, your service account authenticates all access.</p> <p>To get an API key, follow these instructions.</p> <ol> <li>Go to your <a href\="https\://code.google.com/apis/console/" target\="_blank">Google APIs Console</a> and login if necessary.</li> <li>Select the <i>Services</i> item from the menu on the left.</li> <li>Choose the <i>Fusiontables</i> service from the list provided and turn it on.</li> <li>Go back to the main menu and select the <i>API Access</i> item. </li> </ol> <p>Your API Key will be near the bottom of that pane in the section called "Simple API Access".  You will have to provide that key as the value for the <i>ApiKey</i> property in your Fusiontables app.</p> <p>Once you have an API key, set the value of the <i>Query</i> property to a valid Fusiontables SQL query and call <i>SendQuery</i> to execute the query.  App Inventor will send the query to the Fusion Tables server and the <i>GotResult</i> block will fire when a result is returned from the server.  Query results will be returned in CSV format, and can be converted to list format using the "list from csv table" or "list from csv row" blocks.</p> <p>Note that you do not need to worry about UTF-encoding the query.  But you do need to make sure the query follows the syntax described in <a href\="https\://developers.google.com/fusiontables/docs/v2/getting_started" target\="_blank">the reference manual</a>, which means that things like capitalization for names of columns matters, and that single quotes must be used around column names if there are spaces in them.</p>

ImageSpriteHelpStringComponentPallette=<p>A "sprite" that can be placed on a <code>Canvas</code>, where it can react to touches and drags, interact with other sprites (<code>Ball</code>s and other <code>ImageSprite</code>s) and the edge of the Canvas, and move according to its property values.  Its appearance is that of the image specified in its <code>Picture</code> property (unless its <code>Visible</code> property is <code>False</code>.</p> <p>To have an <code>ImageSprite</code> move 10 pixels to the left every 1000 milliseconds (one second), for example, you would set the <code>Speed</code> property to 10 [pixels], the <code>Interval</code> property to 1000 [milliseconds], the <code>Heading</code> property to 180 [degrees], and the <code>Enabled</code> property to <code>True</code>.  A sprite whose <code>Rotates</code> property is <code>True</code> will rotate its image as the sprite"s <code>Heading</code> changes.  Checking for collisions with a rotated sprite currently checks the sprite"s unrotated position so that collision checking will be inaccurate for tall narrow or short wide sprites that are rotated.  Any of the sprite properties can be changed at any time under program control.</p>

If <code>ReceivingEnabled</code> is set to 2 messages will be received only when the application is running. Finally if <code>ReceivingEnabled</code> is set to 3, messages will be received when the application is running <b>and</b> when the application is not running they will be queued and a notification displayed to the user.</p> <p>When a message arrives, the <code>MessageReceived</code> event is raised and provides the sending number and message.</p> <p> An app that includes this component will receive messages even when it is in the background (i.e. when it is not visible on the screen) and, moreso, even if the app is not running, so long as it is installed on the phone. If the phone receives a text message when the app is not in the foreground, the phone will show a notification in the notification bar.  Selecting the notification will bring up the app.  As an app developer, you will probably want to give your users the ability to control ReceivingEnabled so that they can make the phone ignore text messages.</p> <p>If the GoogleVoiceEnabled property is true, messages can be sent over Wifi using Google Voice. This option requires that the user have a Google Voice account and that the mobile Voice app is installed on the phone. The Google Voice option works only on phones that support Android 2.0 (Eclair) or higher.</p> <p>To specify the phone number (e.g., 650-555-1212), set the <code>PhoneNumber</code> property to a Text string with the specified digits (e.g., 6505551212).  Dashes, dots, and parentheses may be included (e.g., (650)-555-1212) but will be ignored; spaces may not be included.</p> <p>Another way for an app to specify a phone number would be to include a <code>PhoneNumberPicker</code> component, which lets the users select a phone numbers from the ones stored in the the phone contacts.</p>

TinyDBHelpStringComponentPallette=TinyDB is a non-visible component that stores data for an app. <p> Apps created with App Inventor are initialized each time they run\: If an app sets the value of a variable and the user then quits the app, the value of that variable will not be remembered the next time the app is run. In contrast, TinyDB is a <em> persistent </em> data store for the app, that is, the data stored there will be available each time the app is run. An example might be a game that saves the high score and retrieves it each time the game is played. </<p> <p> Data items are strings stored under <em>tags</em> . To store a data item, you specify the tag it should be stored under.  Subsequently, you can retrieve the data that was stored under a given tag. </p><p> There is only one data store per app. Even if you have multiple TinyDB components, they will use the same data store. To get the effect of separate stores, use different keys. Also each app has its own data store. You cannot use TinyDB to pass data between two different apps on the phone, although you <em>can</em> use TinyDb to shares data between the different screens of a multi-screen app. </p> <p>When you are developing apps using the AI Companion, all the apps using that companion will share the same TinyDb.  That sharing will disappear once the apps are packaged.  But, during development, you should be careful to clear the TinyDb each time you start working on a new app.</p>

If the user touches the rectangle, controls will appear to play/pause, skip ahead, and skip backward within the video.  The application can also control behavior by calling the <code>Start</code>, <code>Pause</code>, and <code>SeekTo</code> methods.  <p>Video files should be in Windows Media Video (.wmv) format, 3GPP (.3gp), or MPEG-4 (.mp4).  For more details about legal formats, see <a href\="http\://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/media-formats.html" target\="_blank">Android Supported Media Formats</a>.</p><p>App Inventor for Android only permits video files under 1 MB and limits the total size of an application to 5 MB, not all of which is available for media (video, audio, and sound) files.  If your media files are too large, you may get errors when packaging or installing your application, in which case you should reduce the number of media files or their sizes.  Most video editing software, such as Windows Movie Maker and Apple iMovie, can help you decrease the size of videos by shortening them or re-encoding the video into a more compact format.</p><p>You can also set the media source to a URL that points to a streaming video, but the URL must point to the video file itself, not to a program that plays the video.

If you have published applications to the Google Play Store using the keystore you are about to delete, you will lose the ability to update your applications.\
\
Any projects that you package in the future will be signed using your new keystore file. Changing the keystore affects the ability to reinstall previously installed apps. If you are not sure that you want to do this, please read the documentation about keystores by clicking above on "Help", then "Troubleshooting", and then "Keystores and Signing of Applications"\
\
There is no undo for deleting your keystore file.
